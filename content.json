            "Neutral_6": "If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I like being alone, anyways.",
            "Neutral_8": "House-cleaning isn't fun, but when I listen to music and it goes by pretty fast.",

The goblins I've met have been rather friendly and amiable, once I've shown that I mean no harm. Unfortunately, centuries of distrust and ill-treatment from humans has led many Goblins to pursue careers in the employ of witches, warlocks, necromancers, and other unsavory types.^^A traditional Goblin diet largely consists of grub meat, typically from the large and juicy grub varieties native to the Goblin home-forest.

'The Legend'. Dia besar dan buas... Dan semakin kuat aku menarik pancingku, semakin kuat pula dia menarik umpannya. Aku sempat lengah sesaat dan dia membelah perahuku jadi dua bagian. Aku tidak pernah memancing lagi semenjak itu.\nTex: Apa kau pikir ada seseorang yang bisa menangkapnya?\nGordy: Hmm... Jika orang ini ahli memancing, dan bisa menangkap ikan-ikan langka terlebih dulu, dan juga makan makanan yang tepat... maka bisa saja. Hal yang paling penting adalah kau harus menghormati lautan, nak.\nTex:...nak? Jangan-jangan... Kamu...\n ...a...ayah?\nGordy: Ya, putraku.\n\n**Musik Dramatis bermain ketika tirai ditutup**"

Kalian tidak perlu memberinya apa-apa kecuali saat ingin mengganti jenis batuan mulia yang ingin kalian duplikat!\nSayangnya, crystalarium tidak bisa menduplikat batuan mulia yang sangat langka semacam 'Prismatic Shard'...

Dirumorkan juga bahwa dia tinggal di dalam bongkahan pohon yang tenggelam di danau dekat gunung, dan hanya muncul pada saat hujan di musim semi untuk menyantap telur-telur katak.

Dengan ciri-ciri kulit berwarna hijau, mata merah menyala, dan bau busuk, berjumpa dengan Goblin dapat menakutkan bagi wisatawan yang kurang pengalaman.^^Meskipun memiliki penampilan yang meresahkan, Goblin memeiliki kecerdasan dan kapasitas emosional yang mirip seperti manusia, dan tidak bermasalah saat mempelajari bahasa dan adat istiadat kita. Para goblin yang kutemui kebanyakan sangat ramah, setelah aku menunjukkan niat baikku. Sayangnya, berabad-abad diskriminasi dari manusia membuat beberapa goblin bekerja dengan penyihir, ahli nujum, dan sejenisnya.^^Diet tradisional goblin kebanyakan terdiri dari daging, khususnya dari varian daging yang besar dan padat yang berasal dari dekat hutan tempat goblin berasal. Pada kesempatan khusus, Goblin akan memanjakan diri dengan item yang disebut 'void mayonnaise'... yang dianggap terlezat dari semua hidangan Goblin."
